# cs2-redie
**A plugin that allows players to go in Redie/Ghost mode**

**This version is based on [excludera](https://github.com/exkludera)'s [redie](https://github.com/exkludera/cs2-redie) plugin. Its currently used on CS2 Combat Surf server (62.122.214.145:27015)**

### List of changes:
- Allows ghosts to use map teleports (replaced all trigger_teleport with trigger_multiple ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€)
- Exiting redie silently removes player instead of suiciding (just quick team rejoin)
- Ghosts don't take damage from players
- Added noclip and save/load pos for ghosts

### To do:
- Prob disable steps sounds someday
