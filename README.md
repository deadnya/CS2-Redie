# cs2-redie
**A plugin that allows players to go in Redie/Ghost mode**

**This version is based on [excludera](https://github.com/exkludera)'s [redie](https://github.com/exkludera/cs2-redie) and [teleports](https://github.com/exkludera/cs2-teleports) plugins. Its currently used on CS2 Combat Surf server (62.122.214.145:27015)**

### List of changes:
- Allows ghosts to use map teleports (replaced all trigger_teleport with trigger_multiple ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€)
- Exiting redie silently removes player instead of suiciding (just quick team rejoin)

### To do:
- Remove Ghosts' damage taking
- Add noclip command for ghosts
- Add savepos/loadpos for ghosts
- Add hotreload compatibility

> [!CAUTION]
>player in redie still makes walking/jumping sounds (would be nice if anyone knows how to fix that)
>
> behaviour with tp entities other than teleport_trigger and info_teleport_destination was not tested and may result in unexpected stuff
> 
>player in redie can pickup defuse kits
>
>player in redie can do various niche things like opening ski_3's jail

this plugin is still bad but it gets the job done lol
