# Redie for Surf
**A plugin that allows players to go in Redie/Ghost mode**

**This version is based on [exkludera](https://github.com/exkludera)'s [redie](https://github.com/exkludera/cs2-redie) plugin. Its currently used on CS2 Combat Surf server (62.122.214.145:27015)**

### List of changes:
- Working teleports (!!!) (replaced all trigger_teleport with trigger_multiple ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€)
- Silent unredie (just quick team rejoin)
- Ghosts don't take damage from players
- Ghosts don't make step sounds (by [RoxyRekt](https://github.com/roxyrekt))
